# Text-Editor
This was a project I did for my assembly class. I had to create a text editor. I decided to base my GUI off notepad cause I think it was a nice basic color palette (Blue and white). 
It runs from the command line with the parameters being the name of a txt file. I used a file called test.txt that you see in the branch above. 

KNOWN BUGS: There is a bug when using backspace where basically it seems not to function properly and mess up your word/sentence/paragraph. But if you look at the word/sentence/paragraph in memory, it shows backspace worked correctly. I'm currently not sure what's wrong
